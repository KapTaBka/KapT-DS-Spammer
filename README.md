# Discord-Spammer
Spams with messages in a server.

## Information
This was made to show you how easy it is to spam a platform like Discord. People can use this to annoy people or bury messages that they would like to remain unseen. Discord have recently started to rate limit when sending too many requests quickly, but in this example I have included a little "bypass". It uses proxies to prevent yourself from getting rate limited. Not only does it bypass rate limits, but it also hides your identity. Please keep in mind that it is still not 100% safe using proxies, in this example I was using proxyscrape to auto-parse the proxies but most of the proxies are **transparent** proxies. A transparent proxy reveals your IP address as they leave it in its original format. Please do not use this, it is once again only meant for you to learn how spammers work. However, if you choose to use this you are doing it at your own risk.


## Usage
Run this command in CMD, terminal or PowerShell (if you don't already have the **requests** module installed):
```
pip install requests
```
1. Paste your Discord tokens inside Tokens.txt | A Discord token is a "key" that you can use to log into your account.
2. Run the script.
3. Select "Join Server" if the tokens aren't already in the server. If they are, choose "Spam Server".
4. Paste the Discord server's invite code.
5. Paste the Discord server's channel ID that you'd like to spam | Enable "Developer Mode" to see the "Copy ID" option when right clicking on channels.
6. All set!

## Legal Notice
This is illegal if you use this without the consent of the owners (in this case, the Discord team). I am not accountable for anything you get into, this was just a speedrun to demonstrate how spammers work. This is 100% educational, please do not misuse this tool.
